Another Virtual Machine
=======================

This is Another Virtual Machine (AVM) and it is an incremental variation on another MISC.


Opcodes
-------

The opcodes mnemonics have been chosen to be familiar to most people:

	00	nop	no operation					| Flow Control
	01	.	call a subroutine				|
	02	;	return from a subroutine			|
	03	?	branch to tos if nos is true			|	
	
	04	-	negate tos					| Math
	05	+ 	add tos to nos					|
	06	*	multiply					|
	07	/	divide with remainder				|	

	08	~	not (binary compliment)				| Logic
	09	&	and						|
	0a	|	or						|
	0b	^	xor						|
	
	0c	push	put on return stack				| Stack
	0d	pop	fetch from return stack				|
	0e	dup	duplicate tos					|
	0f	drop	drop tos					|
	10	swap	swap tos and nos				|
	11	over	duplicate nos					|
	
	12	!	store to address dst, increment dst		| Memory
	13	+!	add to address dst increment dst		|
	14	@	fetch from address src, increment src		|
	15	+@	add from address src, increment src		|
	16	>d	set dst						|
	17	d>	fetch dst					|
	18	>s	set src						|
	19	s>	fetch src					|

	1a	=	true if nos = tos				| Test
	1b	>	true if nos > tos				|
	1c	<	true if nos < tos				|
	1d	true	all bits high 	(aka -1)			|
	1e	false	all bits low	(aka 0)				|
	
	1f	flag	flag values					| Flags


Registers Files
---------------

The AVM has a couple different registers and register files.

	is	instruction register
	ip	instruction pointer
	ds	data stack file
	dsp	data stack pointer
	rs	return stack file
	rsp	return stack pointer
	dst	destination address
	src	source address
	flg	flags register

There are two conventional virtual registers that are defined as:

	tos	(ds + dsp) modulo SIZEOF(ds)
	nos	(ds + dsp - 1) modulo SIZEOF(ds)

In terms of implementation, the modulo math is acomplished by having
the size of the stack be a power of 2 and the register have the same
number of bits.  The implementation can trap an overflow in the flags
register, but in general the data stack is considered circular.


Instruction Encoding
--------------------

Instructions are encoded as a sequence of 8bit values, packed in a
64 bit word.  Memory is divided between program ROM and process RAM,
following a roughly Harvard architecture.
